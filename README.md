# CollegeProjects
Here, brilliance is etched in ethereal strings of code!

With each click, a cascade of possibilities unfolds, guiding you through the the universe of 
programming languages, frameworks, libraries & all those untouched fields in Tech.

Well, TBH, That's exactly what college made us do in past 6 semesters!!

Well, This repo till date (26 May 2023) just has the 
  1. Rstudio's R-markdown file & explaination pdf (named "ToSubmit.pdf")
  2. Python's DataMining jupyter notebook file with an explanation pdf (named "GitHUB_Knn_Explaination.pdf")

<h3>Okay so, here's the breakdown of the above uploaded files: </h3>
1.1 The dataset used in "Exploratory_Data_Analysis.zip" is 'Telco Customer Churn' from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn & a Bike Sharing dataset also from kaggle.

2.1 The dataset used in "DATA_MINING_assignment.zip" is from here: https://data.police.uk/data/ (Youu can actually fine tune it according to your likings)

You'll love Map-visualization tho, do try that out (only for DATA_MINING_assignment)! (PS: requires longitude & latitude ðŸ¤©)
